# libft

This is my implementation of libft, the foundational project from 42 School. It's a personal library of standard C functions and various utility functions, designed to deepen understanding of C programming fundamentals and memory management. This project serves as a building block for all subsequent 42 C cursus projects.

## Usage

To compile the library, navigate to the project root and run:
```Bash
make
```

This will generate libft.a, a static library file. You can then link this library with your own C programs.

The bonus rule compiles additional functions (e.g., linked list operations) as defined in the project.

```Bash
make bonus
```

## Note on Project State

All projects from my 42 cursus are preserved in their state immediately following their final evaluation. While they may contain mistakes or stylistic errors, I've chosen not to alter them. This approach provides a clear and authentic timeline of my progress and learning journey as a programmer.
